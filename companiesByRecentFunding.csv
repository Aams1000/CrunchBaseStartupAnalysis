greatpoint-energy,GreatPoint Energy,562000000,http://www.greatpointenergy.com,,"GreatPoint Energy is a technology-driven natural resources company and the developer of a proprietary, highly-efficient catalytic process, known as hydromethanation, by which coal, petroleum coke and biomass are converted directly into low-cost, clean, pipeline quality natural gas, while allowing for the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2). 

GreatPoint Energy plans to build, own and operate large-scale natural gas production facilities strategically located at the intersection of natural gas pipelines and low-cost feedstock, as well as at locations where the CO2 produced and captured in its process can be geologically sequestered. The Company has identified numerous such locations and is in advanced development of its first commercial facility. 

The Companyâ€™s cost of production is expected to be significantly lower than current prices of new drilled natural gas and imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), and the natural gas it produces, called bluegasâ„¢ meets all high-grade natural gas quality specifications. It can be transported through the thousands of miles of pipelines already in place around the world and can be used interchangeably with drilled natural gas for all applications, including power generation, residential and commercial heating, and the production of chemicals. 

The Company has raised $140 million to date and is backed by leading strategic investors including The Dow Chemical Company, Suncor Energy, AES Corporation, and Peabody Energy, as well as major financial institutions and venture capital firms, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Khosla Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Advanced Technology Ventures, and Citiâ€™s Sustainable Development Investments.","GreatPoint Energy produces clean natural gas from coal, petroleum coke, and biomass through its catalytic hydromethanation process.",2004-01-01,0,0,,420000000
